. Inefficient and Outdated Irrigation Techniques

Many farms still use traditional irrigation methods (e.g. flood/immersion irrigation) that waste large volumes of water due to evaporation, runoff, or poor distribution. 
Tech Vision


Even some “modern” irrigation infrastructure (when present) suffers from poor maintenance, leaks, or misuse. 


The average “efficiency” of surface irrigation remains low: for example, areas using surface irrigation only achieve maybe 40 % water-use efficiency in some cases. 


Result: Much of the water allocated for agriculture doesn’t actually go to crops — it’s lost. With scarcity, this inefficiency becomes a big waste.




PROBLEM 2 : 
- "Farmers waste tons of water by watering their fields in the morning, then it rains a few hours later - wasting water, money, and sometimes killing crops from overwatering."
WHY THIS IS BETTER : 
✅ Stop watering before rain = save 30% water instantly
✅ Prevent crop diseases from overwatering = bigger harvest
✅ Save money on electricity and water bills every month
✅ Use water only when actually needed = sustainable farming




PROBLEM 3:
IoT Smart Irrigation Monitor—a solar-powered prototype using sensors to track soil moisture, water flow, and quality in real-time, auto-adjusting irrigation via app alerts and ML predictions to cut waste by 20-70%.​

Core Problem It Solves
Algerian farms lose 30-50% of water to undetected leaks, overwatering, and manual scheduling mismatches with droughts, especially in northern schemes like Sidi Bel Abbès where public quotas ignore real-time data. This prototype provides continuous monitoring absent in 85% of systems, enabling precision for smallholders amid aquifer depletion





1. Smart Irrigation Scheduler (AI-based)

Use soil sensors + weather data + ML to automatically decide when and how much to irrigate. Reduces water waste and increases yield.

2. Groundwater Extraction Monitoring

Track well water usage using flow meters to prevent aquifer depletion and illegal extraction. Includes dashboards and alerts.

3. AI Crop Selection & Rotation Tool

Recommends optimal crops and rotations based on soil quality, water availability, and climate forecasts to reduce soil degradation.

4. Low-Cost IoT Drip Irrigation Kit

Affordable, easy-to-install IoT system that automates drip irrigation using simple sensors and solar power.

5. Water Resource Planning Dashboard

A national/regional tool for forecasting irrigation demand, drought risk, and water allocation using climate + geospatial data.
