. Inefficient and Outdated Irrigation Techniques

Many farms still use traditional irrigation methods (e.g. flood/immersion irrigation) that waste large volumes of water due to evaporation, runoff, or poor distribution.

Even some “modern” irrigation infrastructure (when present) suffers from poor maintenance, leaks, or misuse. 


The average “efficiency” of surface irrigation remains low: for example, areas using surface irrigation only achieve maybe 40 % water-use efficiency in some cases. 


Result: Much of the water allocated for agriculture doesn’t actually go to crops — it’s lost. With scarcity, this inefficiency becomes a big waste.
