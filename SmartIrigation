. Inefficient and Outdated Irrigation Techniques

Many farms still use traditional irrigation methods (e.g. flood/immersion irrigation) that waste large volumes of water due to evaporation, runoff, or poor distribution. 
Tech Vision


Even some “modern” irrigation infrastructure (when present) suffers from poor maintenance, leaks, or misuse. 


The average “efficiency” of surface irrigation remains low: for example, areas using surface irrigation only achieve maybe 40 % water-use efficiency in some cases. 


Result: Much of the water allocated for agriculture doesn’t actually go to crops — it’s lost. With scarcity, this inefficiency becomes a big waste.




PROBLEM 2 : 
- "Farmers waste tons of water by watering their fields in the morning, then it rains a few hours later - wasting water, money, and sometimes killing crops from overwatering."
WHY THIS IS BETTER : 
✅ Stop watering before rain = save 30% water instantly
✅ Prevent crop diseases from overwatering = bigger harvest
✅ Save money on electricity and water bills every month
✅ Use water only when actually needed = sustainable farming
