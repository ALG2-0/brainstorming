# 🚀 AgroConnect DZ: Hackathon Project Overview

This document summarizes our three proposed high-impact solutions addressing market inefficiencies, food loss, and supply chain fragmentation in Algerian agriculture.

## 1. AgroMind: Predictive Planting System

### 🧠 The Problem
Farmers plant blindly, leading to **massive overproduction** (like the "potato crisis") and price crashes, resulting in significant financial loss and food waste.

### 💡 The Solution
An **AI platform** that uses historical data and current Wilaya reports to advise farmers on the **most profitable crop** to plant for the upcoming season, preventing market surplus.

### 🛠 Core Tech
* **AI (Forecasting Models):** Python-based predictive analytics.
* **Data Visualization:** Dashboard for planning and risk assessment.

## 2. FreshTrack IoT: Smart Cold Chain

### 🚛 The Problem
Up to **25% of crops spoil** during long-distance transport ("Talaf al Ma7sol") due to breaks in the cold chain and lack of monitoring.

### 💡 The Solution
A **real-time IoT monitoring system**. Sensors placed inside the transport vehicle track temperature and humidity, guaranteeing the freshness of goods.

### 🛠 Core Tech
* **IoT:** ESP32/Arduino and DHT sensors.
* **Mobile App:** Instant alerts to the buyer and driver if the temperature exceeds safe limits.

## 3. SouqLink: Direct B2B Marketplace

### 🤝 The Problem
**Middlemen ("Mandataires") inflate prices** by 200-300%, maximizing consumer costs while minimizing farmer profits. Lack of trust hinders remote transactions.

### 💡 The Solution
A digital **B2B Marketplace** connecting farmers directly to bulk buyers (hotels, factories, etc.).

### 🛠 Core Tech
* **AI (Computer Vision):** Automatically grades produce quality from a photo to build remote trust.
* **CS/Fintech:** Secure **Escrow Payments** to ensure farmer payment upon delivery confirmation.
